These scripts are the kind of scripts that we want to replace with laoban.

Note that they look like 'cut-and-paste abuse'

* Any change to project structure requires a change to all the scripts
* There is no parallelism so they are slow (especially on a big project with lots of packages)
* They are not very portable (e.g. they only work on windows)
