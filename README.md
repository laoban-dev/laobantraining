# This is an example project that shows how we can add `laoban` to existing projects

## Structure

This typescript monorepo project has very simple business logic to focus on the `laoban` integration .
There is a `main` package that uses two libraries `lib1` and `lib2`. 

The main package just displays the values defined in the two libraries.

The training course using this is [here](https://laoban.dev/laoban/training/EXISTING.html)
