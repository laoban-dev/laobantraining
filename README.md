# This is an example project that shows how we can add `laoban` to existing projects

## Structure

This typescript monorepo project has very simple business logic to focus on the `laoban` integration . There is a `main`
package that uses three libraries `lib1`, `lib2` and 'lib3. One is a javascript library and two are typescript library

The main package just displays the values defined in the two libraries.
